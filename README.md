# COM SCI 174A Final Project

### Project Overview

Our project is separated into two components:
* Record player simulation
* Target shooting game
  * Shooting a target awards 12 points
  * The player has a maximum of 3 shots which recharge over time
  * The player also expends 2 points per shot
  * Projectiles will break upon hitting a target and create a realistic shattering effect with particles affected by gravity
  * Projectiles will not break upon hitting a wall and instead correctly ricochet
  * Game over if projectile hits the player or time runs out
  * Score 100 points to win
Note: The player may switch between third and first person cameras to make shooting targets easier
